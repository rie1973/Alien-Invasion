## Lessons Learned

I know, I know...another "school" project. Practice makes (nearly) perfect. The more I do it, the better I get at it. So here we are!

**What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?**

This was my first time creating a game using Python. I am using this exercise to keep my Python progamming skills fresh, learn new concepts and technologies (VS Code), reading documentation, as well as honing my debugging skills. I am also learning how to navigate through large scale projects, how the individual attributes are creating the different user aspects of the game, and the methods interact with each other across the entire platform.
